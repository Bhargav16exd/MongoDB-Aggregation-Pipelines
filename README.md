# MongoDB Aggregation Task

This repository contains the solutions for the MongoDB aggregation pipeline

**Dataset**

The queries are written for the `movies` and `comments` collections from the `mflix` database in a free M0 MongoDB Atlas cluster.

**Resources Used**

-   MongoDB CRUD Operations
-   Query Operators
-   Aggregation Pipeline
-   Aggregation Pipeline Stages
-   Aggregation Pipeline Operators

## What I Learned

This task provided a deep understanding of MongoDB's aggregation pipeline and its capabilities for handling complex queries and data transformations. Key learnings include:

1.  **$lookup for Joins**:

    -   Learned how to join data between collections, which is essential for relational-like operations in MongoDB.

2.  **Using $project and $group**:

    -   Understood how to shape data output by selecting specific fields and grouping data for summaries or counts.

3.  **$unwind and Array Operations**:

    -   Explored breaking down arrays into individual documents and processing them further.

4.  **Sorting and Limiting Data**:

    -   Gained insights into sorting large datasets efficiently and limiting the results to top-n records.

5.  **Conditional Queries and Transformations**:

    -   Learned to use conditions like date filters and calculate fields dynamically during the pipeline.

6.  **Performance Optimization**:

    -   Recognized the importance of indexing and efficient pipeline stages to optimize query performance.

7.  **Schema Design for Output**:

    -   Gained experience in structuring the output to match specific requirements for automated testing.
